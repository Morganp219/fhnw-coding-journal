"_your brain’s cache isn’t as big as you think it’s time to log your journey like a true dev hero_" - Devlink Tips

During your time at Fort Hays Tech | Northwest, you will encounter new syntax, programming languages, and concepts. As developers, we do not remember everything we do, but writing notes will assist us in remembering everything we learn and research. Your future self will thank you later!

These Journals do not have to have *dear journal*, or any of that; instead, put straight to the point, you should be able to write these in about 5 minutes! Do this any time you learn something new, research something new, or just as part of the day. 

Template.md - We gave you a suggested template; you do not need to fill out each one, just the ones that will assist you in your future endeavors
